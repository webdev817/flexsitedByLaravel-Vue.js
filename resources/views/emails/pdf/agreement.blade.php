      <br>
      <br>
      In consideration of the mutual obligations hereunder, both parties agree as follows:

      &nbsp; &nbsp; • A laboratory certified by the Department of Health and Human Services’ SAMHSA Agency.
      <br>

      5. Upon Company’s request by written consent, Quality Consortium Services will release drug and
      alcohol (D&A) testing history and information in accordance with DOT, other regulatory agencies or a

      <br>
      <i>Company’s Obligations and Responsibilities:</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      To qualify for and maintain enrollment in Quality Consortium Services C/TPA program, the Company
      agrees to: <br>
      <b>1.</b> Maintain a Company Policy for controlled substance and alcohol (D&A) misuse implemented before
      initiating testing. Complete verification of prior drug, alcohol violations for each new member. <br>
      <b>2.</b> For reasons of reasonable suspicion testing, Company agrees to have a person who supervises
      employees or members trained in the aid of recognizing the signs and symptoms of substance abuse and
      alcohol misuse, unless self employed. <br>
      <strong>3.</strong> Notify Quality Consortium Services immediately of any changes in Company information including
      name, address, telephone number(s), (office, mobile and/or emergency numbers), fax number(s),

      information. <br>
      <strong>4.</strong> Notify Quality Consortium Services immediately of any changes in the status of a Company’s

      <b>5.</b> Have new employee / member complete a pre-employment drug screen, for DOT employees /
      members in safety sensitive positions. Employee / Member can only be added to the Random Pool with
      a negative DOT drug test result. If Company elects not to forward test results to C/TPA, they are

      Companies responsibility to ensure that employees / members are properly and adequately tested. <br>

      alcohol collection site once they are notified of a random testing selection by the DER. <br>
      <b>7.</b> Fully document any reason(s) leading to the failure to comply with all requests for a random test.
      Failure to randomly test your employees or members may result in termination from Quality Consortium
      Services program and Company agrees to the release of this information to any applicable and
      appropriate regulatory enforcement agencies. <br>
      <b>8.</b> Determine if post-accident drug and alcohol testing is necessary following any accident. If testing is
      required, it is the Companies responsibility to locate a collection site and ensure the individual is tested
      within the appropriate timeframe. <br>
      <b>9.</b> Ensure an employee / member does not resume safety sensitive duties prior to SAP approval and
      Return-to-Duty testing. <br>
      <b>10.</b> Notify Quality Consortium Services immediately and remove employee / member from service upon
      notification from either: <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; a. A Medical Review Officer (MRO) that an individual tested positive on a DOT drug test; or <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; b. Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT) or Saliva Alcohol Technician that the individuals confirmation
      test result has an alcohol concentration of .02 or greater. <br>
      <b>11.</b> Responsibility to establish an alternate provision within their Company’s D&A policy pertaining to
      post accident testing when a Quality Consortium Services collection site or personnel is unavailable. (e.g.

      provisions and is an additional and separate fee. <br>
